# gobo
All in one Go CLI base app framework

Every Go project, for greatest efficiency, has several basic services that are implemented in one way or another:

- command line arguments and environment variable parameters
- JSON configuration files in subfolders of app data directory
- CLI help system
- low overhead logging with configurable outputs and rotators
- keyboard controlled and filesystem watcher recompile/restart triggering

Just clone, change the origin URL and build with a simple, consistent and performant starting framework for building any modern golang CLI/Server application.
